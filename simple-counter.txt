; Simple counter program
; This program counts from 1 to 10 and then stops

start:  MOV R0 #1        ; Initialize counter to 1
        MOV R1 #10       ; Set upper limit to 10

loop:   ; Display the counter (in real CPU this would output to screen)
        ; For our simulator, we'll just see the value in R0
        
        ADD R0 #1        ; Increment counter
        CMP R0 R1        ; Compare counter with limit
        JLT loop         ; Jump back if counter < limit
        
        ; When we get here, counter has reached limit
        HLT              ; Halt the CPU
